## About Webister

Welcome to Webister, A project that uses C++, Python, and PHP. This project allows you to host more than one website on one computer. It comes with an auto installer script to make the process much easier and 100% faster.

Our code is so clean and very organized, it make developers smile. We use a script that will automatically clean the code and check for errors. You can host as many websites you want and have resellers. Webister is also great for managing a server because it is very simular to most hosting control panels.

The control panel uses bootstrap 4 and an icon framework to enrich the user experience and make the user layout much easier. The control panel also is very friendly on mobile devices which means we will not have to create an app.

If you want to advertise on the users website, you can also do that through the main control panel. There are plenty of features and extentions you can get to enrich the users experience even further.

You can integrate our code into most platforms. We hope to expand to WHMCS and different billing technologies. We also plan to integrate with Cloudflare to improve the speed of the website.
